    "ANS:Multithreading is the ability of a program or an opereating system to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of the program runnig on the computer.\n",
    "multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory.Multithreading in python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks.It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time , thereby increasing the performance.\n",
