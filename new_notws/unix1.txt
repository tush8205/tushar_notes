** tail  --list bottom n record
 tail [OPTION]... [FILE]..
 -n , -c , -f :follow change in file ,-s :sleep interval

** cut 
 extract part of each line of  file . it cuts out a set of byte or characters or fielda from each row of the file based on the delimiter
 
 
 **Comm command
 comm [option]... FILE1 FILE2
 Comm command compares two sorted files line by line and 
 produces three column output when no options were passed to it. 
 Column one contains lines unique to file1, column two contains lines unique to file2, and column three contains lines common to both files.

** diff command
The command "diff" compare files line by line.
 This command becomes helpful when you wish to know the exact record level differences. 
 It tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions between files. 
 Typically, diff is used to show the changes between two versions of the same file.

diff [OPTION]... FILES
-i -- disregards the case differences
-c -- to compare two program code differences
-q  -- reports whether files differ or not 


NOTE:Line numbers from the first file
A letter (a for add d for delete c for change)
Line numbers from the second file
So, 1,2c1 means that the lines from 1,2 in first file need to be changed to match the line number 1 in second file.

The second and third lines in the above output are the lines from first file followed by a separator and 
then the next line is from second file.
Lines preceded by "<" are lines from the first file
Lines preceded by ">" are lines from the second file


! symbol prefixed to few lines where the change is expected
+ symbol prefixed to lines indicates that this line in second file, needs to be added to the first file
-  symbol Indicates a line in the first file that needs to be deleted
Tryout: Try comparing 2 files using cmp command and observe the format of output.


uniq - Removing the repeated lines 
 used to remove / eliminate the repeated occurrence of consecutive lines from a file .\
 if same file is present in the file more than once , but not consecutive it will be considered as two unique lines and hence not removed.
-u  = selecting non repeates lines 
-d = selecting the duplicate lines
-c = counting the frequency of occurrence


ACCESS PERMISSION 
requirements  has to be taken care 
A user should not be able to make change to the files created by another user
A user should not be able to delete the files created by another user 


three access permission 
Read 
Write 
Execute

used to computing the file permission for newely createdfile 



Data Backup 
take backup -- 
cp== copy a file one to anothr directory
 cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY


,mv== move or rename files 
 mv [option]...SOURCE...DIRECTORY,
tar,cpio
Moving files to another partition-- mv
archive the files -- tar 
Recovering data from backup -- tar , cpio



Archiving files 
tar - command saves many files together into a single archive and can redtore individual fiels from the archive 
tar [option]...[file]..
-c = creat
-t= list all files 
-x= Extrct all 
-v = Verbose
-z= Create a Zip file 
-r = Append 
-cvf= Create archive from file
-tvf= List all files in archive.tar verbosrly 
-xf = Extrct all file from archive.tar
-cvf = crate a tar archive files 
-cvzf = create a compressed gzip archive files 
-rvf = Append a file to existing archive
/%s  



cpio- used to creating archive and extrcting files that are arechived and also use to copy one location to another .
-ov = crate an archive 
-idv= extract files from archive
-F = CREATING / extracting tar archive files
-it = List the files in archive 


vi == open file 
:w == save changes
:wq == save change and exit 
:q == exit from editor
:q! == exit from editor and discard changes made 
:/_____ == direct search word 

:1,3co5   == to copy lines from 1 to 3 and paste them after line 5.
:1,4w abc.txt == write line 1 to 4 file abc.txt
